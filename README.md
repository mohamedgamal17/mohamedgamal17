## Hi there 👋


I’m a Full Stack Developer specializing in Angular and ASP.NET Core, building scalable, modular, and production-grade web applications grounded in clean architecture principles.

Experienced in modern architectural patterns including modular monoliths and microservices, with a strong focus on Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and Test-Driven Development (TDD). I design systems with maintainability, scalability.

Passionate about continuous learning, improving engineering practices, and exploring advanced system design concepts to build robust and resilient software.
